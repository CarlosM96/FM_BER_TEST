2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
TIMING-6#1 Critical Warning
No common primary clock between related clocks  
The clocks clk40 and clkout0 are related (timed together) but they have no common primary clock. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks clk40] -to [get_clocks clkout0]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-7#1 Critical Warning
No common node between related clocks  
The clocks clk40 and clkout0 are related (timed together) but they have no common node. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks clk40] -to [get_clocks clkout0]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-8#1 Critical Warning
No common period between related clocks  
The clocks clk40 and clkout0 are found related (timed together) but have no common (expandable) period
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-51#1 Critical Warning
No common phase between related clocks from parallel CMBs  
The clocks clk40 and clkout0 are timed together but have no phase relationship. The design could fail in hardware. The clocks originate from two parallel Clock Modifying Blocks and at least one of the MMCM or PLLs clock dividers is not set to 1. To be safely timed, all MMCMs or PLLs involved in parallel clocking must have the clock divider set to 1.
